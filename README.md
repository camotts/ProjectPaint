## Synopsis
I don't understand how markdown files are formatted
We're making a game thing???
Currently planned features:
Mobile Deployment
Gps Tracking (or something similar) to determine where on the map you are
Tag areas for your team
Tag other team players to stop them from tagging areas for their team
Tag other team players while in an area tagged for your team to convert them to your team
## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

There's a game feature digital media competition thing??? Called RED STICK FUTURE FEST

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.
